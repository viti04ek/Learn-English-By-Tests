The simple present is a verb tense with two main uses. We use the simple present 
tense when an action is happening right now, or when it happens regularly (or 
unceasingly, which is why it`s sometimes called present indefinite). Depending on the 
person, the simple present tense is formed by using the root form or by adding ‑s or 
‑es to the end.

---------------------------How to Form the Simple Present---------------------------
In the simple present, most regular verbs use the root form, except in 
the third-person singular (which ends in -s).

First-person singular: I write

Second-person singular: You write

Third-person singular: He/she/it writes (note the ‑s)

First-person plural: We write

Second-person plural: You write

Third-person plural: They write

For a few verbs, the third-person singular ends with -es instead of -s. 
Typically, these are verbs whose root form ends in o, ch, sh, th, ss, gh, or z.

First-person singular: I go

Second-person singular: You go

Third-person singular: He/she/it goes (note the ‑es)

First-person plural: We go

Second-person plural: You go

Third-person plural: They go

For most regular verbs, you put the negation of the verb before the verb, e.g. 
“She won`t go” or “I don`t smell anything.”

The verb to be is irregular:

First-person singular: I am

Second-person singular: You are

Third-person singular: He/she/it is

First-person plural: We are

Second-person plural: You are

Third-person plural: They are

------------------------How to Make the Simple Present Negative-----------------------

The formula for making a simple present verb negative is do/does + not + [root form of verb]. 
You can also use the contraction don`t or doesn`t instead of do not or does not.

EXAMPLE: Pauline does not want to share the pie. 
She doesn`t think there is enough to go around. Her friends do not agree. 
I don`t want pie anyway.

To make the verb to be negative, the formula is [to be] + not.

EXAMPLE: I am not a pie lover, but Pauline sure is. You aren`t ready for such delicious pie.

---------------------------------How to Ask a Question---------------------------------

The formula for asking a question in the simple present is 
do/does + [subject] + [root form of verb].

EXAMPLE: Do you know how to bake a pie? How much does Pauline love pie?
