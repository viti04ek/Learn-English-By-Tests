The simple future is a verb tense that`s used to talk about things that haven`t 
happened yet.

EXAMPLE: This year, Jen will read War and Peace. It will be hard, but she`s 
determined to do it.
--------------------------How to Form the Simple Future--------------------------
The formula for the simple future is will + [root form of verb].

EXAMPLE: I will learn a new language. Jen will read that book. 
My brothers will sleep till noon if no one wakes them up. You will see what I mean.

It doesn`t matter if the subject is singular or plural; the formula for the simple 
future doesn`t change.

Butâ€¦

There is another way to show that something will happen in the future. It follows 
the formula [am/is/are] + going to + [root form verb].

EXAMPLE: I am going to learn a new language. Jen is going to read that book. 
My brothers are going to sleep till noon if no one wakes them up. 
You are going to see what I mean.

The "going to" construction is common in speech and casual writing. Keep in mind 
though that it`s on the informal side, so it`s a good idea to stick to the 
will + [root form] construction in formal writing.
----------------------How to Make the Simple Future Negative----------------------
To make the simple future negative, the formula is will + not + [root form].

EXAMPLE: Jen will not quit before she reaches her goal. Make sure you arrive on 
time tomorrow because the bus will not wait for you. He will not say anything bad 
about his boss. I will not finish my homework in time for class.

Using the "going to" construction, the formula 
is [am/is/are] + not + going to + [root form].

EXAMPLE: Jen is not going to quit before she reaches her goal.
------------------------------How to Ask a Question------------------------------
To ask a question in the simple future, the formula is will + [subject] + [root form].

EXAMPLE: Will Jen finish War and Peace over the summer? Will I have the discipline 
to study Spanish every day? What will you buy with the money you found?

The formula for the "going to" construction is 
[am/is/are] + [subject] +going to + [root form].

EXAMPLE: Is Jen going to finish War and Peace over the summer? Am I going to have 
the discipline to study Spanish every day?
